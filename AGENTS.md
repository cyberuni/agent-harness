# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository.

## Feature Planning

Use GitHub issues for feature planning by default. At the end of a brainstorming or design session, create a GitHub issue (via the `create-issue` skill) to capture the spec. Reference the issue number when resuming work in a future conversation.

## Commit Discipline

**Auto-commit rule:** When a unit of work is complete and verified, commit it immediately. Do not wait for the user to ask. Batching multiple units into one commit, or finishing all work before committing, are both violations of this rule.

**Unit of work:** one coherent, independently revertable change. That means one domain's refactor, one feature, one bugfix, one test suite expansion for one concern, or one config change. Never two unrelated concerns in the same commit. A TDD red-green-refactor cycle alone is not a commit boundary; commit when the full intended change is complete and tests pass. If the working tree has unrelated changes, leave them unstaged, commit the current unit first, then continue.

- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- One concern per commit; never batch unrelated changes
- Stage only files for this unit: `git add <files>`, then verify with `git diff --cached`
- Never use `git add .`, `git add -A`, or `git add -p` (interactive commands agents cannot run)
- Never commit with red tests; run validation commands first

## Skill Augmentations

When loading any skill, also check `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for project-level additions and merge them with the base skill. Files in `.agents/skills/` extend (not replace) the installed skill.

## Project overview

`agent-harness` is a TypeScript toolkit for working with AI agent harnesses. It detects which
harness is running (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, and more), queries what it
holds (its managed-policy locations, plugin storage, enabled plugins, and how it names plugin
skills), and resolves named reference documents layered across the managed, project, user, and
plugin tiers. It depends on no other agent-layer package; ordinary npm libraries are fine. It exists
so `universal-plugin`, `buddy-agent-harness`, `repobuddy`, and `cyberlegion/cyber-mux` share one
implementation instead of each re-detecting harnesses on their own.

The library is published to npm from `packages/agent-harness` as `@cyberuni/agent-harness`. It will
also ship as an agent plugin, like `universal-plugin` does for itself.

Research comes before code: every harness fact the library encodes rests on
`.research/harness-detection`. The library must not claim to detect a harness it has not verified.

## Where things live

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/agent-harness/src` | Library source, one folder per domain concept |
| `packages/agent-harness/AGENTS.md` | Architecture rules for the library source |
| `.research/<topic-slug>` | Vendor findings, one folder per topic |
| `apps/web` | The documentation site |

## Research structure

Each topic under `.research/<topic-slug>/` holds four files:

- `conclusion.md`. The current best answer. Read this first.
- `topic.md`. The full investigation record.
- `evidence.md`. Claims logged with source URLs and confidence.
- `changes.md`. Dated update history.

A claim about a vendor decays, so check `evidence.md` for the source URL and re-verify against
vendor documentation before you rely on one.
