 *
 * - `primary`: the primary checkout. Never removed, with no override.
 * - `foreign`: owned by another tool or person (`classifyOwner`), or outside this library's layout.
 * - `leased`: held by this library's lease. git itself refuses to remove it (E-GIT-L3); `release`
 *   it first.
 * - `prunable`: its checkout is already gone; `git worktree prune` collects the entry.
 * - `busy`: a live agent session works inside.
 * - `unverified`: the process probe could not read this platform, and the caller kept the strict
 *   rule.
 * - `dirty`: uncommitted changes, tracked or untracked.
 * - `dirty-unknown`: git could not say whether it is clean.
 * - `unmerged`: its branch has not landed on the default branch.
 * - `merge-unknown`: whether it landed cannot be told (detached HEAD, or no default branch).
